# psruby-learning
This is the repository to hold the code written while running through the Pragmatic Studios Ruby classes. 

Started on 31 January 2023

Current as of 13 February 2023

Progress tracker:
- Lesson 1: Introduction and Installation of Ruby.  
  - No issues as I had already done some earlier work in Ruby and had it installed.
- Lesson 2: Running Ruby.  
  - Went through this easily as well
- Lesson 3: Numbers and Strings.  
  - Biggest struggle is I'm used to strongly typed languages and Ruby is a bit more free-spirited
- Lesson 4: Variables and Objects.  
  - Still a bit free-spirited for my nature lol but so far it's making sense
- Lesson 5: Self.  
  - Yep, ok, this makes sense at least in theory
- Lesson 6: Methods.
  - This seems pretty straight forward with what I've previously learned.
- Lesson 7: Classes.
  - Also relatively straight forward with what I'd expect
- Lesson 8: Attributes.
  - This is actually neat, the free-spirited nature of ruby makes get/set situations much simpler
- Lesson 9: Arrays
  - yay Ruby didn't free spirit themselves into starting with 1 or something silly like that.
- Lesson 10: Objects Interacting
  - Spent quite a bit of time with this one as this was simple yet a little unfamiliar
- Lesson 11: Seperate Source Files
  - Straight forward, also did some refactoring to get the two projects named better and in seperate folders
- Lesson 12: Unit Testing
  - Struggled a little with syntax but after doing it for both the game and the fundraising app it is making sense, though I'm not convinced I tested every possibility.  But, that may be the QA brain coming out.
- Lesson 13: Conditionals and TDD
  - Took some time on this one.  Unit testing needs more work, conditionals are OK as long as I remember Ruby's weird syntax issues. Also had a bit of a breakthrough on how the classes and methods interact.
- Lesson 14: Modules
  - Spent some time fiddling with this, did some refactoring of the funding code, updated unit tests to reflect that
- Lesson 15: Blocks
  - This is one of those fun lessons where experts just whip out these common methods like we should all know them lol.  But, google searching helped me find a method I wanted for something and what they were saying made a ton of sense.  Also I'm fairly certain there's a bug in the fundraising project but will troubleshoot it more tomorrow.
- Lesson 16: Symbols and Structs
  - This is making sense.  Which means I either missed something important or it is as easy as it seems.
- Lesson 17: Hashes
  - Going to need to spend more time with this.  Got the project to work, but need more time with it
- Lesson 18: Custom Iterators
  - Will need to do this a bit more I think.  I got the challenges done but it'll take a little bit to cement.  Also spent some time cleaning up the mess I had made of the fundraising project, I had methods on the wrong class and just a hot mess.  But the massive refeactor helped cement some things and was successful all tests run
