Current as of 2 February 2023

Progress tracker:
- Lesson 1: Introduction and Installation of Ruby.  
  - No issues as I had already done some earlier work in Ruby and had it installed.
- Lesson 2: Running Ruby.  
  - Went through this easily as well
- Lesson 3: Numbers and Strings.  
  - Biggest struggle is I'm used to strongly typed languages and Ruby is a bit more free-spirited
- Lesson 4: Variables and Objects.  
  - Still a bit free-spirited for my nature lol but so far it's making sense
- Lesson 5: Self.  
  - Yep, ok, this makes sense at least in theory
- Lesson 6: Methods.
  - This seems pretty straight forward with what I've previously learned.
- Lesson 7: Classes.
  - Also relatively straight forward with what I'd expect
- Lesson 8: Attributes.
  - This is actually neat, the free-spirited nature of ruby makes get/set situations much simpler
- Lesson 9: Arrays
  - yay Ruby didn't free spirit themselves into starting with 1 or something silly like that.
- Lesson 10: Objects Interacting
  - Spent quite a bit of time with this one as this was simple yet a little unfamiliar
- Lesson 11: Seperate Source Files
  - Straight forward, also did some refactoring to get the two projects named better and in seperate folders
- Lesson 12:
